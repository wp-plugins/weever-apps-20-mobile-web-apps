Weever Apps: Turn your site into a true HTML5 'web app' for iPhone, Android and Blackberry - weeverapps.com

== Description ==

Weever is a service that turns your WordPress site into a mobile web app for iPhone, Blackberry Touch, Android and iPad.  Or, use our service to convert the HTML5 web app into a native app for Apple or Android.

Weever functions and feels like a native iOS, Android, or Blackberry app, except with no App Store barriers!

This plugin enables you to build and manage your app entirely within WordPress' administrator backend, utilizing best practices to present your content for a mobile-specific context. App users will be able to quickly and easy find your latest news, follow your social network feeds, touch to make a phone call or email you, watch your videos, browse your photo feeds, and more.

Setting up a Weever App is extremely easy. All you do is:

- Sign up for an subscription key at http://weeverapps.com/pricing
- Install the plugin
- Paste in the API key
- Start adding content and branding to your app!

The plugin will forward mobile devices to your app, and automatically provides the app with the most up-to-date info, so you do not have to manage both your app and your site.

Currently supports:

- Blog content from pages, categories, tags, and custom taxonomy
- Creation of a landing page or a slide-show using Wordpress page content
- Contact information
- Social: Twitter, Facebook, Identi.ca
- Video: Youtube, Vimeo
- Photo: Flickr, Picasa, Facebook Albums, Foursquare Venue Photos
- Events: Google Calendar, Facebook Events
- Forms through Wufoo
- Maps using geolocation stored in posts (using the Wordpress mobile apps for iPhone, Android and Blackberry, or the Geolocation plugin)
- App works for iPhone/iPod/iPad, Android devices, Blackberry touch devices, with further compatibilities coming soon.

Additional Features:

- Sandbox Mode: allows developers to play around with new layouts or work on an app for a new version of a site without needing another API key and without affecting a Live app.
- QR Codes: This extension will generate QR codes both for quick previewing of your app as you're building it, and for promoting your app publicly.
